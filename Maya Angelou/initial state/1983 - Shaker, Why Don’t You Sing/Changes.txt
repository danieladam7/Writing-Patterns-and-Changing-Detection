Fickle comfort steals away
What it knows
It will not say
What it can
It will not do
It flies from me
To humor you.
Capricious peace will not bind
The severed nerves
The jagged mind
The shattered dream
The loveless sleep
It frolics now
Within your keep.
Confidence, that popinjay,
Is planning now
To slip away
Look fast
It's fading rapidly
Tomorrow it returns to me.
