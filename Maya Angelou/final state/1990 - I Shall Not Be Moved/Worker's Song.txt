Big ships shudder
down to the sea
because of me
Railroads run
on a twinness track
'cause of my back
Whoppa, Whoppa
Whoppa, Whoppa
Cars stretch to
a super length
'cause of my strength
Planes fly high
over seas and lands
'cause of my hands
Whoppa, Whoppa
Whoppa, Whoppa
I wake
start the factory humming
I work late
keep the whole world running
and I got something … something
coming … coming….
Whoppa
Whoppa
Whoppa
