She was afraid of men,
sin and the humors
of the night.
When she saw a bed
locks clicked
in her brain.
She screwed a frown
around and plugged
it in the keyhole.
Put a chain across
her door and closed
her mind.
Her bones were found
round thirty years later
when they razed
her building to
put up a parking lot.
Autopsy read:
dead of acute peoplelessness.
