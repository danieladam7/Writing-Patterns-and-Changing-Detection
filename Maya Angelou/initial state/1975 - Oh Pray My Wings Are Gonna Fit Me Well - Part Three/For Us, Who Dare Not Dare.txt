Be me a Pharaoh
Build me high pyramids of stone and question
See me the Nile
at twilight
and jaguars moving to
the slow cool draught.
Swim me Congo
Hear me the tails of alligators
flapping waves that reach
a yester shore.
Swing me vines, beyond that baobab tree,
and talk me chief
Sing me birds
flash color lightening through bright green leaves.
Taste me fruit
its juice free-falling from
a mother tree.
Know me
Africa.
