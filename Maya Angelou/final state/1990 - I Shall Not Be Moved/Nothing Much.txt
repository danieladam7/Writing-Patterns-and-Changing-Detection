But of course you were
always nothing. No thing.
A red-hot rocket, patriotically
bursting in my
veins. Showers of starsâ€”cascading stars
behind closed eyelids. A
searing brand across my
forehead. Nothing of importance.
A four-letter word stenciled
on the flesh of my inner
thigh.
Stomping through my brain's
mush valleys. Strewing a
halt of new loyalties.
My life, so I say
nothing much.
