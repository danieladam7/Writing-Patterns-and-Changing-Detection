After Eli Whitney's gin
brought to generations’ end
bartered flesh and broken bones
Did it cleanse you of your sin
Did you ponder?
Now, when farmers bury wheat
and the cow men dump the sweet
butter down on Davy Jones
Does it sanctify your street
Do you wonder?
Or is guilt your nightly mare
bucking wake your evenings’ share
of the stilled repair of groans
and the absence of despair
over yonder?
