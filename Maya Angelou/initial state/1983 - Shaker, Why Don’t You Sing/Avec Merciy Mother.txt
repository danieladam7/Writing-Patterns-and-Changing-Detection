From her perch of beauty
posing lofty,
Sustained upon the plaudits
of the crowd,
She praises all who kneel and
whispers softly,
“A genuflection's better
with head bowed.”
Among the mass of people
who adore her
A solitary figure
holds her eyes.
His salty tears invoke
her sweet reaction,
“He's so much like his daddy
when he cries.”
