I met a Lady Poet
who took for inspiration
colored birds, and whispered words,
a lover's hesitation.
A falling leaf could stir her.
A wilting, dying rose
would make her write, both day and night,
the most rewarding prose.
She'd find a hidden meaning
in every pair of pants,
then hurry home to be alone
and write about romance.
