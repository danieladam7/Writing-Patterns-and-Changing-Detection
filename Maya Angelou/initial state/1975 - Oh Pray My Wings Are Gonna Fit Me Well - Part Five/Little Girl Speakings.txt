Ain't nobody better'n my Daddy,
you keep yo’ quauter,
I ain't yo’ daughter,
Ain't nobody better'n my Daddy.
Ain't nothing prettier'n my dollie,
heard what I said,
don't pat her head,
Ain't nothing prettier'n my dollie.
No lady cookinger than my Mommy,
smell that pie,
see I don't lie,
No lady cookinger than my Mommy.
