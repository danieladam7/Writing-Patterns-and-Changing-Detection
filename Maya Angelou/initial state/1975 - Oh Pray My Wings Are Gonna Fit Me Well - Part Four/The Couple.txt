Discard the fear and what
was she? Of rag and bones
a mimicry of woman's
fairy-ness
Archaic at its birth.
Discharge the hate and when
was he? Disheveled moans
a mimesis of man's
estate
deceited for its worth.
Dissolve the greed and why
were they? Enfeebled thrones
a memory of mortal
kindliness
exiled from this earth.
