You drink a bitter draught.
I sip the tears your eyes fight to hold,
A cup of lees, of henbane steeped in chaff.
Your breast is hot,
Your anger black and cold,
Through evening's rest, you dream,
I hear the moans, you die a thousandsâ€™ death.
When cane straps flog the body
dark and lean, you feel the blow.
I hear it in your breath.
