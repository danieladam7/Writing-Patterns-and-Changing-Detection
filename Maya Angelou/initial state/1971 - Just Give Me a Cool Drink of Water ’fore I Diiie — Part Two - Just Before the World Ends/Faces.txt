Faces and more remember
then reject
the brown caramel days of youth.
Reject the sun-sucked tit of
childhood mornings.
Poke a muzzle of war in the trust-frozen eyes of a favored
doll.
Breathe, Brother,
and displace a moment's hate with organized love.
A poet screams “CHRIST WAITS AT THE SUBWAY!”
But who sees?
