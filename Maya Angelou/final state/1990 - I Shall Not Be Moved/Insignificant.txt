A series of small, on
their own insignificant,
occurrences. Salt lost half
its savor. Two yellowstriped
bumblebees got
lost in my hair.
When I freed them they droned
away into the afternoon.
At the clinic the nurse's
face was half pity and part pride.
I was not glad for the news.
Then I thought I heard you
call, and I, running
like water, headed for
the railroad track. It was only
the Baltimore and the Atchison,
Topeka, and the Santa Fe.
Small insignificancies.
