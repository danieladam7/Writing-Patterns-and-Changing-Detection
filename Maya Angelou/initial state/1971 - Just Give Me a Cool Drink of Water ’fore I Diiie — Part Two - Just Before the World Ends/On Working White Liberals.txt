I don't ask the Foreign Legion
Or anyone to win my freedom
Or to fight my battle better than I can,
Though there's one thing that I cry for
I believe enough to die for
That is every man's responsibility to man.
I'm afraid they'll have to prove first
That they'll watch the Black man move first
Then follow him with faith to kingdom come.
This rocky road is not paved for us,
So, I'll believe in Liberalsâ€™ aid for us
When I see a white man load a Black man's gun.
